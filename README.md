## 🗂️ Dataset Overview

The project uses synthetic data generated with Faker and Python. Each CSV contains 350+ rows to simulate a mid-sized university environment.

| Table Name   | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `students`   | Basic student info including DOB, gender, department, etc. |
| `faculty`    | Faculty profile with department and joining date |
| `departments`| University departments and their HODs |
| `courses`    | Courses offered by each department |
| `enrollments`| Records of which students took which courses and their grades |
| `attendance` | Attendance records per student per course |
| `exams`      | Midterm and final exam schedules per course |
| `marks`      | Exam scores for each student |
| `feedback`   | Student ratings and comments for faculty and courses |


Insights Extracted from SQL Queries

Useful for tracking academic pressure or over-enrollment.

Faculty Performance Based on Feedback:

Calculated average feedback rating for each faculty member.
Supports faculty evaluations and reward systems.

Department-Wise Student Extraction (Computer Science):

Retrieved all students and their emails from the Computer Science department.
Can be used for targeted communication or departmental audits.

Demanding Courses Identification:

Listed all semester 1 courses with more than 3 credits.
Helps in identifying challenging or core courses.

Low Attendance Alert:

Found students who were absent more than 5 times in any course.
Useful for intervention, counseling, or disciplinary action.

Top Performers by Course and Exam:

Extracted students with the highest cumulative marks in each course.
Assists in generating merit lists and awards.

Feedback Gaps by Students:

Identified students who have never submitted feedback for any faculty.

Useful for institutional ranking and departmental benchmarking.

Faculty Teaching Breadth:

Found the number of different courses each faculty received feedback for.
Indicates teaching diversity and course handling load.

Consistent Underperformance:

Listed students who failed in 2 or more different courses.
Helps flag students for academic intervention and support.

Summary of Audit Use Cases
